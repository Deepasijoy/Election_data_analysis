# Election_data_analysis
Code Basic's resume challenge to analyse LokSabha 2014 &amp; 2019 election data. The task was to analyze the data without any bias and less explored themes like voter turn-out, constituency wins. 
The data sets came in two files Fact_2014 and fact_2019. These files were cleaned and transformed using Python. Three separate tables were created using 'composite key'(Pc_name/constituency name & State). The dimension tables created 1) Candidate data 2)Constituency Data 3) Merged Vote fact file with 2014 & 2019 data.
These were then loaded to Tableau to visualize the data.
